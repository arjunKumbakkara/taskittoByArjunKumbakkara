## What is TASKITTO?

**TASKITTO** is a clean, quadrant-based productivity app designed to **organize, focus, and execute** tasks with absolute clarity. Inspired by the Eisenhower Matrix and supercharged with smart features like **drag-and-drop task management**, **due-date prioritization**, and an integrated **Pomodoro timer**, it turns chaos into clarity.

---

## Key Features

### 🧭 Four Productivity Quadrants:
- 🟥 **Immediate Now** – Tasks that need your focus right away.
- 🟧 **Today** – Tasks you plan to complete today.
- 🟨 **Week** – Mid-term tasks to complete within the week.
- 🟩 **Month** – Long-term tasks or milestones.

Each quadrant displays a **due date** marker on its edge, keeping your priorities visible and actionable.

---

### 🖱️ Drag and Drop Task Management
Move tasks freely between quadrants to reflect your changing priorities. TASKITTO mirrors your mental task map, visually and interactively.

---

### ⏳ Pomodoro Focus Mode
Built into the **"Immediate Now"** section is a clean, elegant **Pomodoro timer**. It helps you:
- Focus on one immediate task
- Work in sprints (25-min default)
- Take breaks efficiently
- Stay in flow while tracking progress

---

### 📜 Task History Log
Every completed task is stored in the **History** section. Great for:
- Reviewing what you've accomplished
- Reflecting and iterating
- Weekly retrospectives

## 🧠 Why TASKITTO?

We’re overloaded with tools that do too much and show too little.  
**TASKITTO** respects your attention, surfaces what matters *now*, and gives you the control to plan forward.  
Built by a builder who lives in the real world — where clarity, simplicity, and *getting things done* matter most.
