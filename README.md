### 🔲 Quadrant-Based Task Layout – Powered by the Eisenhower Matrix  
 ![00f41aef-7b51-48c1-b0cb-a8bc5cb5bc9d](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7faab38-069d-41e3-a40b-16dcd75c95de)

At the heart of TASKITTO lies the **Eisenhower Matrix**, a time-tested productivity technique that helps you distinguish between urgency and importance.  
The layout is broken down into four intuitive, color-coded quadrants:

- 🔴 **Immediate Now** – Tasks that are both urgent and important. These are high-priority actions that need immediate attention.
- 🟠 **Today** – Important but less urgent tasks that should be completed by the end of the day.
- 🔵 **This Week** – Tasks that are important but not pressing. These are perfect for scheduling throughout the week.
- 🟢 **This Month** – Long-term objectives and low-urgency tasks to track without overwhelming your daily bandwidth.

With **drag-and-drop** capability and intuitive due date tags, TASKITTO helps you maintain focus while staying flexible.

### 🎯 Focus Mode – Pomodoro Timing + 5 Second Rule Activation  
![b1423a81-34b4-46e0-aa66-8b6d70754158](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec046fd0-c615-4cf8-8633-305812b8dd88)

When a task is moved into the **Immediate Now** quadrant, **Focus Mode** is activated.  
Here’s what happens:

- A **25-minute Pomodoro Timer** starts, encouraging deep work through short, structured sprints.
- The **5 Second Rule**, popularized by motivational speaker **Mel Robbins**, kicks in. It starts with a 5-4-3-2-1 countdown — a behavioral activation method proven to break hesitation and spark action.  
    > _“If you have an instinct to act on a goal, you must physically move within 5 seconds or your brain will kill it.”_ – Mel Robbins

This dual approach ensures you're not just planning tasks but actually acting on them.

When a task is designated as your focus, TASKITTO sends a subtle **browser push notification** to remind you what matters most — right now. These timely nudges keep you in flow without relying solely on willpower.
